.Sh NAME
.Nm rgrep
.Nd recursive grep
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar flags
.Ar pattern
.Ar path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
recursively searches files in the named paths (or searches stdin if
no arguments are given) for lines containing the given
.Ar pattern .

Like the more-traditional grep, it has many options that change
how it works, but many of these options are subtly different:

.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Li -c
Count matches;  don't print the lines that contain the patterns,
just the matches.
.It Li -e
Use POSIX-style regular expressions.
.It Li -h
Highlight line that match the pattern.
.It Li -H
Highlight the text that matches the pattern.
.It Li -i
Ignore case.
.It Li -l
Print the name of each file that contains a the pattern.
.It Li -n
As well as the line, print the line number of each line
that matches the pattern.
.It Li -F
Follow links.
.It Li -r
Recursively scan through directories (this is the default.)
.It Li -N
Don't recurse.   This makes
.Nm
into a somewhat clumsy superslow grep.
.It Li -R Ar pat
Search only filenames that match 
.Ar pat .
.It Li -v
Print (count) only lines that do NOT contain the pattern.
.It Li -x Ar pat
Search only filenames that have the extension
.Ar pat .
.It Li -D
Instead of searching, just print the names of the directories that
would be searched.    (This makes
.Nm
into a somewhat slower version of 
.Xr find 1 )
.It Li -W Ar len
Input files contain fixed-length records
.Ar len
characters long.
